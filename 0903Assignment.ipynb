    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of each specific value. For example, rolling a fair six-sided die has a PMF where each face (1 through 6) has a probability of 1/6. The Probability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables and describes the relative likelihood of values over an interval, but not exact probabilities. For example, a uniformly distributed variable between 0 and 1 has a PDF of 1 within that range. The probability of falling within a specific interval is found by integrating the PDF over that interval."

This theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This makes the normal distribution a key tool for statistical inference.\n",

Understanding the normal distribution allows for the correct application and interpretation of these tests.\n",

For example, consider flipping a fair coin where getting heads can be considered a success (1) with a probability of 0.5, and getting tails can be considered a failure (0) with a probability of 0.5.
