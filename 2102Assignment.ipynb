    "Web Scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves sending requests to a web server, retrieving the HTML content of web pages, and then parsing that content to extract relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection: To gather large amounts of data from the web that would be difficult or time-consuming to collect manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive Analysis: Businesses use web scraping to monitor competitorsâ€™ prices, product listings, and other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Research: To collect data for analysis on trends, customer behavior, and market conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Three Areas Where Web Scraping is Used to Get Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: To track product prices, availability, and reviews across different online retailers. For instance, a price comparison tool might use web scraping to gather and compare prices of products from various e-commerce sites.\n",
