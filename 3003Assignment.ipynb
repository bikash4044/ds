    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines features of both Ridge and Lasso regression. Here's how it works and how it differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination of Penalties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: Uses both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. Its objective function is:\n",
    "RSS + lambda1 * sum(|beta_i|) + lambda2 * sum(beta_i^2)\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Uses only the L2 penalty (squared coefficients).\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Uses only the L1 penalty (absolute values of coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity and Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: Can handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection, similar to Lasso, but also benefits from Ridge's ability to handle correlated features.\n",
    "Ridge: Primarily shrinks coefficients but does not perform feature selection.\n",
    "Lasso: Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, which may be less effective if features are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: Requires tuning two parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, which control the strength of the L1 and L2 penalties, respectively."

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the data into training and validation sets.\n",
    "Train the Elastic Net model using different values for the regularization parameters (lambda1 for L1 penalty and lambda2 for L2 penalty).\n",
    "Evaluate performance on the validation set.\n",
    "Select the combination of lambda1 and lambda2 that yields the best performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error).\n",

    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Balances Feature Selection and Shrinkage: Combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties, allowing it to perform feature selection while also shrinking coefficients, which can lead to better model performance and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles Multicollinearity: Effective when features are highly correlated, as it can handle multicollinearity better than Lasso alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves Stability: More stable than Lasso in the presence of highly correlated features, since L2 penalty helps in distributing the coefficient values more evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Offers a trade-off between Ridge and Lasso, making it a versatile choice for different types of datasets and model requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires Tuning Two Parameters: Needs optimization of both lambda1 (L1 penalty) and lambda2 (L2 penalty), which can increase computational complexity and make parameter selection more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Overfitting: If not properly tuned, the model might still overfit the training data, especially with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: More complex than using Ridge or Lasso alone, which might be unnecessary if only one type of regularization is sufficient for the problem at hand."

    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Dimensional Data: When the number of features is large compared to the number of observations, such as in genomics or text classification, Elastic Net helps with feature selection and manages multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlated Features: In cases where features are highly correlated, such as in finance or biological data, Elastic Net can handle multicollinearity better than Lasso alone by using both L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Models with Regularization: When a model needs to be both sparse and regularized, such as in machine learning tasks where interpretability is important, Elastic Net provides a balance between feature selection (Lasso) and regularization (Ridge).\n",

    "Predictive Modeling: In predictive modeling scenarios where a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage is needed, such as in insurance risk modeling or customer behavior prediction.\n",
