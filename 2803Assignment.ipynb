    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a type of regularized linear regression that introduces a penalty to the loss function to prevent overfitting. It modifies the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a regularization term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Loss = RSS + λ * sum(coefficients^2)\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "RSS is the residual sum of squares (sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values).\n",

    "λ is the regularization parameter, controlling the strength of the penalty.\n",

    "Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression: Minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) without any regularization term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Minimizes the RSS plus a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients (L2 norm).\n",
    "Penalty:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression: No penalty for the magnitude of the coefficients, which can lead to overfitting if there are many features or if features are highly collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Includes a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients towards zero, which helps to reduce overfitting and handle multicollinearity by constraining the magnitude of the coefficients.\n",
    "Impact on Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression: Coefficients can become very large if the model is overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Coefficients are penalized, making them smaller and more stable, which improves generalization to unseen data."

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnitude: The coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, but they are shrunk towards zero due to regularization. Smaller coefficients indicate less influence on the response variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "Comparative Importance: Coefficients in Ridge Regression are shrunk compared to those in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression. Comparing the magnitude of coefficients can provide insights into the relative importance of predictors, though the shrinkage makes them less straightforward to interpret than OLS coefficients."
