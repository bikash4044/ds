    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Uses physical servers housed in data centers. Resources like CPU, RAM, and storage are fixed and dedicated.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Utilizes virtualized resources distributed across multiple servers and data centers. Resources are scalable and elastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Scaling requires physical upgrades or additional servers, which can be slow and costly.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Provides on-demand scaling, allowing resources to be adjusted automatically based on traffic or usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Often involves fixed pricing based on server specifications. Costs are generally higher for hardware upgrades or additional capacity.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Follows a pay-as-you-go model where you pay only for the resources you use. Costs can be more flexible and can scale with your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Single server or a set of servers may lead to single points of failure. Downtime can occur if the hardware fails.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Offers high reliability and redundancy by distributing resources across multiple servers and data centers. Failover mechanisms ensure minimal downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Requires managing physical servers, including hardware maintenance, updates, and upgrades.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Abstracts the hardware management. Cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance, allowing you to focus on application management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Performance is limited to the specifications of the physical server and can be affected by other users if on shared hosting.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Performance can be optimized with resources spread across multiple servers and auto-scaling based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Less flexible with resource allocation and upgrades.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Highly flexible, allowing for quick adjustments and resource allocation based on current needs."
