    "Q1. What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points, while Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. Euclidean distance can be more sensitive to outliers, while Manhattan distance is less sensitive and can perform better in high-dimensional spaces."

    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric affects how distances between data points are calculated, impacting classification or regression results. Euclidean distance works well in spherical or evenly distributed data, while Manhattan distance can be better in grid-like or high-dimensional spaces. Choose based on data structure and problem characteristics."
