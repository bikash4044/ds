    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function in Logistic Regression\n",
    "The cost function in logistic regression is called Log Loss or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss. It measures how well the predicted probabilities match the actual outcomes.\n",

    "Formula\n",
    "For one data point, the cost function is:\n",

    "Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization in Logistic Regression\n",
    "Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function, which encourages the model to be simpler and more generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works\n",
    "Penalty Term: Adds a penalty based on the size of the model's weights to the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): Adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights. It can shrink some weights to zero, effectively selecting a subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost=−[y⋅log(y_)+(1−y)⋅log(1−y_)]+λ∑∣wi|\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): Adds the sum of the squared weights. It helps keep weights small and reduces the influence of less important features.\n",

    "Cost=−[y⋅log(y_)+(1−y)⋅log(1−y_)]+λ∑wi^2\n",
    "\n",

    "Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents Overfitting: By discouraging large weights, regularization reduces the risk of the model fitting noise in the training data.\n",

    "Model Evaluation: The ROC curve helps in assessing how well the model distinguishes between the positive and negative classes.\n",
