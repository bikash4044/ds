    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a technique for feature selection that evaluates the relevance of features based on their statistical properties and relationships with the target variable, independent of any machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method works by applying statistical tests or criteria to assess each featureâ€™s relevance. Features are evaluated using metrics such as correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, mutual information, or ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine their relationship with the target variable. Each feature is then ranked according to its score or statistical association with the target. Based on these rankings, a subset of the top features is selected, either by setting a specific threshold or choosing a fixed number of top-ranked features. This selection process is independent of any machine learning algorithms, making it a straightforward and computationally efficient approach."

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: Evaluates feature subsets by training and testing a specific machine learning model; model-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: Assesses features independently of any model using statistical tests or metrics; model-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: Selects features based on the performance metrics of a model trained with different subsets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: Uses statistical measures or tests to score features based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: Generally more computationally expensive due to repeated model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: Usually less computationally intensive, as it does not involve model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: Can capture interactions between features by evaluating feature subsets within the context of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: Assesses features individually, potentially missing interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: Provides flexibility tailored to specific models, considering how features influence model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: Offers a more general assessment of feature relevance, applicable across different models."
