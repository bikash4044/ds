    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics involves using sample data to make inferences about a population parameter. It helps provide an estimate of unknown characteristics of a population based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value calculated from sample data that serves as an estimate of a population parameter. For example, if you want to estimate the average height of a population, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate provides a range of values, rather than a single point, within which the population parameter is expected to lie. This range is associated with a level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the mean height might be 65 to 70 inches, indicating that you are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within this range."

    "Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing statements, called hypotheses, and using statistical methods to determine which hypothesis is supported by the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-Making: Hypothesis testing provides a framework for making decisions based on data. It helps determine whether observed effects or differences are statistically significant or likely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Validation: It is used to validate scientific research and experiments. By testing hypotheses, researchers can confirm or refute theories and claims based on empirical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Management: In fields like medicine, finance, and quality control, hypothesis testing helps manage risk by evaluating whether interventions or changes have significant effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Assessment: It offers an objective method for assessing whether sample data supports a particular claim or hypothesis, reducing bias and subjective judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence-Based Decisions: It provides a systematic way to make decisions based on statistical evidence, enhancing the reliability and validity of conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Progress: Hypothesis testing is fundamental to scientific research, allowing researchers to test theories and contribute to knowledge and advancements in various fields."
